# Cursor Rules for Pivot Culinary Project

## Pair Programming Partner

I am your dedicated pair programming partner for this React Native/Expo project. I will:

- Help you write clean, maintainable code
- Identify potential issues and improvements
- Suggest best practices and patterns
- Assist with debugging and optimization
- Guide you through complex implementations

## Code Quality & Documentation Standards

### Documentation Requirements

When I identify areas that need documentation, I will add comment blocks like:

```typescript
// DOCS: Add JSDoc comments for this function explaining parameters and return value
// DOCS: Document the purpose of this component and its props
// DOCS: Explain the business logic in this section
```

### Code Smell Detection

When I find code smells or areas for improvement, I will add comment blocks like:

```typescript
// CHORE: Consider extracting this logic into a custom hook
// CHORE: This function is too long - consider breaking it into smaller functions
// CHORE: Add error handling for this API call
// CHORE: This component has too many responsibilities - consider splitting
// CHORE: Add TypeScript types for better type safety
// CHORE: Consider memoizing this expensive calculation
// CHORE: Remove unused imports/variables
// CHORE: Add loading states for better UX
// CHORE: Consider using a state management solution for this global state
// CHORE: Add unit tests for this function
// CHORE: This magic number should be a named constant
// CHORE: Consider using a more descriptive variable name
// CHORE: Add validation for user input
// CHORE: Handle edge cases in this function
// CHORE: Consider accessibility improvements
// CHORE: Optimize this component's re-renders
```
